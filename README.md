# Spam-Detector-
Using real life text data I  constructed a spam/ham classifier of the message in the inbox

**Requirements**
1. ipython Notebook Link to install :- https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html
2. scikit learn Use command :- Pip install scikit learn
3. Pandas module Use Command :- Pip install Pandas

**How to run**

After installing the ipython notebook keep the data file "sms.tsv" in the same documentry as the ipynb file

**Short Description**

I'm creating a spam ham detector using machine learning with text.
We know that machine learning model requires numerical data to compute and find the results therefore we are first vectorizing the
textual data into vectors and than feeding it to our models.
I have used Naive bayes and Logestic regression for it depending on your machine you can switch to either(LR is faster than Naive Bayes.)
